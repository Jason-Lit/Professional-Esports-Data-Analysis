# Professional Esports Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of data from professional Valorant players. The dataset, compiled from two sources, contains fourteen relevant statistics for 5600 professional players. The primary objectives of this analysis were to aggregate, process, and clean the dataset for subsequent visualizations and machine learning.

## Key Contributions

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Aggregated, processed, and cleaned the dataset, ensuring data quality and consistency for further analysis.

2. **Standardized Rating System:**
   - Developed a standardized rating system based on the top five most important statistics for each player. This rating provides a comprehensive measure of player performance.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Utilized Seaborn, a Python data visualization library, to create informative plots. These plots showcase key findings, particularly focusing on the relationship between rounds played and various rating metrics.

4. **Cluster Analysis:**
   - Conducted k-means clustering to identify patterns between player earnings and performance statistics. This analysis helps in understanding how different groups of players exhibit distinct trends in their earnings based on their in-game performance.
